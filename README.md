# Reflection Report – Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration & Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This project was created as part of the **Internship Task – Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration & Page Design**.  
I built a **personal portfolio website** using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5**, designed to be modern, responsive, and visually appealing.  
The website consists of three main pages — **Home**, **About**, and **Contact** — each demonstrating key Bootstrap components and responsive layout techniques.

## Steps I Followed

1. **Project Setup**
   - Created a new folder and added files: `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, and `style.css`.
   - Linked Bootstrap 5, Bootstrap Icons, and a custom CSS file through CDN.

2. **Component Exploration**
   - Explored Bootstrap documentation and examples to understand layout and responsive design patterns.
   - Selected components like Navbar, Cards, Carousel, Modal, and Forms for my pages.

3. **Home Page Development**
   - Added a Navbar for navigation across pages.
   - Designed a Hero Section introducing myself.
   - Included a “What I Do” feature section using Cards.
   - Integrated a Carousel showcasing project screenshots.
   - Added a Modal for Certifications and a clean Footer layout.

4. **About Page Development**
   - Highlighted my background, education, and work experience.
   - Added sections for Interests and Technologies mastered using Bootstrap cards and grids.

5. **Contact Page Development**
   - Created a functional contact form using Bootstrap form controls and validation.
   - Displayed contact details and social links.
   - Implemented JavaScript validation with user feedback.

6. **Styling and Responsiveness**
   - Customized Bootstrap colors and hover effects in `style.css`.
   - Used utility classes for padding, margins, and shadows.
   - Tested responsiveness on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

7. **Version Control and Hosting**
